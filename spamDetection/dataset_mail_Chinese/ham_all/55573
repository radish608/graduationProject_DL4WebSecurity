我写的一篇essay,大家帮忙看看,U of TEXAS-Austin要求的,大家多提宝贵意见,指出一些语法错误,谢谢了.发在别的版没人搭理. Topic: Many students expand their view of the world during their time in college. Such growth often results from encounters between students who have lived different cultural, economic, or academic experiences. With your future growth in mind, describe a potential classmate that you believe you could learn from either within or outside a formal classroom environment. "指出一些语法错误"? 你不如要大家指出语法用词正确的地方!

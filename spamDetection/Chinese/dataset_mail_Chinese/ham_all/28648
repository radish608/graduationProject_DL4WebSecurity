干嘛说英语，ft I feel so boring recently, don\'t wanna do anything, just sit before the computer and look like an idoit. Actually I should\'ve been really busy. As a senior in college, I should seek for a decent job or prepare for TEM8, but I just dont wanna do anything but waste time. Basically, I\'m a senior college student major in English, I\'m shiny,easy-going, humorous... yet sometimes in deep nights I feel lonely, and really need someone who can hear and share with my thoughts.
